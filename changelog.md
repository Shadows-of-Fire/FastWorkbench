## 4.6.1
* Fixed a dupe bug that could occur if the player inventory was full when using a workbench.
* FB will now crash the game when an invalid recipe (a recipe that matches but produces no output) is detected, instead of infinitely looping.

## 4.6.0
* The mod has been rewritten to use mixins instead of JS coremods and registry replacement.
* Some unnecessary calls during the shift-crafting process have been trimmed.
* Non-vanilla non-special recipes that have their output contents change anyway will be properly updated.
